                Hi! My name is Celina and I am an upcoming junior this fall, majoring in computer science and planning on graduating next
                year in the winter!
                
                <br><br> I was first exposed to coding around middle school where we utilized the iconic platform also known as Scratch; we created
                differing projects using the well known orange cat avatar as well as block coding which is where most of us start coding from. After
                this period of my life, I began to explore more and dive into video games which peaked my interest in the backend and frontend parts.
                I always enjoyed art, although I was not the best artist and hoped that in the future, I could combine my interest in both subjects 
                and develop games as well as software applications that others can use.

                <br><br>
                Throughout high school, my interest in software development and computer science overall began to increase as the years went by
                and eventually, I took my school's AP Computer Science Principles class as well as joining my school's coding club to which helped me
                realize my love and affinity for coding. I enjoyed the algorithms and problem solving that came with coding (as well as the many
                frustrating moments where it was always one line of code that was wrong, but it takes hours to find that bug); I also enjoyed coding
                with others on projects as well through hackathons!

                <br><br>Eventually, I decided to enter college as a first generation student as a computer science major in hopes of pursuing a career in 
                software development and engineering and be able to create projects that others as well as myself can utilize in their daily lives.

                <br><br>
                Outside of coding and algorithms, I enjoy exploring bubble tea places as well as making jewelry and bullet journaling! </font>
